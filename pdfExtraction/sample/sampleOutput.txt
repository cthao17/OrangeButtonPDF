First Solar Series 4™
PV Module

ADVANCED THIN FILM SOLAR TECHNOLOGY

INDUSTRY BENCHMARK SOLAR MODULES

As a global leader in PV energy, First Solar’s advanced thin film solar modules
have set the industry benchmark with over 17 gigawatts (GW) installed worldwide
and a proven performance advantage over conventional crystalline silicon solar
modules. Generating more energy than competing modules with the same power
rating, First Solar’s Series 4™ and Series 4A™ PV Modules deliver superior
performance and reliability to our customers.
